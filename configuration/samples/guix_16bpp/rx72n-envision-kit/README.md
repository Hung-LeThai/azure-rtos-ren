2. Caution / Known Issue
------------------------
2.1. The device on RX72N Envision Kit is R5F572NN (Flash memory 4MB).
However, when creating new project with old board version (v1.11 and older),
the project is created with R5F572ND device (Flash memory 2MB).
You can go to [Board] tab of Smart Configurator editor to check the correctness of the device.
In case the device is R5F572ND, at Board tab, you can click [...] button behind the Board combo-box
to quickly go to Change Device dialog and change target device to R5F572NN.

This issue is fixed from board version v1.12.


2.2. If you are using e2 studio 2022-04 or earlier verion with GCC RX compiler, please take note on following issue.

For this GUIX 16bpp sample project, RAM2 should be used for sections in src/linker_script.ld
However, the section setting is changed to RAM in linker_script.ld when first build and after code generated.
You can simply copy src/linker_script_sample.ld to src/linker_script.ld, and build project again
