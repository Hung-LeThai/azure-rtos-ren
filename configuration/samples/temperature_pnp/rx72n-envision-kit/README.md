2. Caution / Known Issue
------------------------
The device on RX72N Envision Kit is R5F572NN (Flash memory 4MB).
However, when creating new project with old board version (v1.11 and older),
the project is created with R5F572ND device (Flash memory 2MB).
You can go to [Board] tab of Smart Configurator editor to check the correctness of the device.
In case the device is R5F572ND, at Board tab, you can click [...] button behind the Board combo-box
to quickly go to Change Device dialog and change target device to R5F572NN.

This issue is fixed from board version v1.12.
